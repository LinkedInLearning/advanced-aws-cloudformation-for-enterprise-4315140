With AWS CloudFormation, DevOps professionals are able to create a collection of AWS and third-party resources, then easily provision, manage, and automate them. Join IT architect and Notre Dame professor Brandon Rich as he covers the skills you need to know to get the most out of AWS CloudFormation for enterprise.

Expand your technical know-how as a DevOps pro and AWS system administrator, exploring built-in functions, the AWS command line, custom resources, composable and reusable templates, CloudFormation macros, and more. By the end of this course, youâ€™ll be ready to not only provision and manage your own resource collections, but to successfully automate them as well.



## Instructions
- For most of the course content, you'll be fine to just clone this repository and work from a local copy. 
- However, if you want to make changes or if you would like to follow along with the later video on automating templates via Code Pipeline, you'll need to fork the repo into your own account. This will give you a copy that you can treat as your own.
